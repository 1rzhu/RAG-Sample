In the ancient kingdom of Avenfell, time flowed through a massive clocktower in the town square. No one knew who built it. No one questioned how it worked. They simply bowed their heads when the bell chimed each hour, knowing that time itself obeyed the tower.

Elara, the young daughter of the royal clockmaker, was the only one who dared ask questions. Her father, Master Thalen, guarded the tower’s secrets fiercely, and when Elara touched the gears, she could feel them humming like a heartbeat.

One winter evening, as snow fell in spirals that never touched the ground, the tower fell silent. The chimes froze mid-note, and the kingdom stopped with it: birds halted in midair, rivers stilled, and even candle flames froze like painted fire.

Only Elara could move.

Confused and terrified, she climbed the silent tower. There she discovered a silver hourglass hidden behind the main gear. Frozen inside it was a drifting shard of blue light. When she touched it, the shard cracked—and a voice whispered, “Release me.”

The hourglass shattered. A boy of pure light appeared, weak and flickering. He called himself Caelum, the Spirit of the Sixty-First Minute—a magical sliver of time the world had forgotten. He had been imprisoned centuries ago by a sorcerer-king who feared losing control over fate.

Because Caelum was missing, time itself was incomplete—and now it had collapsed.

Elara agreed to help him regain his strength. Together they traveled through the frozen kingdom, collecting lost moments trapped in shimmering bubbles: a child’s first laugh, a healer’s secret formula, the last note of a song. With every moment restored, Caelum grew brighter.

But the sorcerer-king’s shadow also returned, furious that his ancient spell had been broken. He rose from his icy tomb beneath the mountains and summoned a blizzard powerful enough to erase time entirely.

In a storm of white and lightning, Elara placed her hands on the giant gears of the clocktower and poured her memories into the mechanism—every tear, every triumph, every moment that made her who she was.

The gears spun. The bell rang.

Time roared back to life.

The sorcerer-king shattered like brittle winter glass, and Caelum transformed into a radiant being of golden daylight. Before departing back into the flow of time, he gifted Elara a silver pendant shaped like an hourglass.

“If time forgets you,” he said, “shake this—and I will remember.”

Elara became the first keeper of time—a guardian not of minutes and hours, but of memories themselves.
